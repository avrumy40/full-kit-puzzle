Objective:
Create a simple web-based puzzle game that illustrates the Theory of Constraints (TOC) concept of "Full-kit" by showing the importance of having all necessary components before starting a task.

User Flow:
1. Welcome Screen:
    * The game begins with a welcome screen featuring the game title and a brief introduction.
    * A short message explains the game's goal: to assemble a puzzle efficiently.
    * An optional link or button provides more information about the Full-kit concept.
    * The user clicks "Start" to proceed.
2. Puzzle Selection
    * the game can auto-select a default puzzle for simplicity.
3. Instructions Screen:
    * A concise instruction page informs the user that puzzle pieces will appear in batches.
    * It highlights that starting assembly without all pieces might lead to inefficiencies.
    * The user is advised to decide whether to start immediately or wait for all pieces.
    * The user clicks "Continue" to begin the game.
4. Gameplay Start:
    * The puzzle workspace appears with an empty puzzle frame.
    * A timer starts counting down, indicating the total time allotted (e.g., 5 minutes).
    * The first batch of puzzle pieces (e.g., 30% of total pieces) is available for assembly.
5. Piece Release Mechanism:
    * Puzzle pieces are released in multiple batches at set intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
    * A progress bar or countdown shows when the next batch will arrive.
    * Each batch adds more pieces until all are available.
6. User Interaction:
    * Users can drag and drop available pieces into the puzzle frame at any time.
    * Pieces snap into place when correctly positioned.
    * If users place pieces early, they might need to adjust them when new pieces arrive.
    * Users can rearrange pieces as needed but with time implications.
7. Challenges Demonstrating Full-kit:
    * Early assembly without all pieces may lead to misplaced pieces or the need for rework.
    * Users experience delays caused by adjusting the puzzle with each new batch.
    * Waiting for all pieces before starting allows for smoother and quicker assembly.
8. Visual and Audio Feedback:
    * Sound effects or visual cues indicate the arrival of new batches.
    * Notifications remind the user of the remaining time and pieces.
9. Completion:
    * The game ends when the puzzle is fully assembled or the timer runs out.
    * A summary screen displays the user's performance metrics:
        * Total time taken to complete the puzzle.
        * Number of times pieces were moved or adjusted.
        * Efficiency rating based on their strategy.
10. Feedback and Reflection:
    * A message explains how the user's choices affected their efficiency.
    * It connects the gameplay experience to the Full-kit concept:
        * Starting without all pieces led to rework and delays.
        * Waiting for all pieces could have resulted in faster completion.
    * Encourages users to consider how this applies to real-world tasks.
11. Replay Option:
    * Users can choose to replay the game to try a different strategy.
    * This allows them to directly compare the outcomes of different approaches.
12. Exit or Share:
    * Option to exit the game or share their results on social media (optional).
    * Provides links or resources for learning more about TOC and Full-kit.

Design Considerations:
* Simplicity:
    * The interface is clean and intuitive, focusing on user engagement.
    * Controls are straightforward: click, drag, and drop.
* Timing:
    * Batch intervals and total game time are balanced to create meaningful choices without causing frustration.
    * The timing mechanism is transparent, so users are aware of when new pieces will arrive.
* Accessibility:
    * The game is web-based and runs smoothly on common browsers.
    * It's compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
* Engagement:
    * Visuals are appealing but not distracting.
    * Sound effects and animations enhance the experience without overwhelming the user.
* Educational Emphasis:
    * The game subtly reinforces the Full-kit principle without overtly lecturing.
    * Reflection prompts encourage users to think critically about their in-game decisions.
